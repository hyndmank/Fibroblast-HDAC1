This is the code used to analyze normal rat kidney fibroblasts (NRK49F from ATCC) that were overexpressing human HDAC1 plasmids (Addgene, 13820) or empty vector control (Addgene, 138209_. Subsets of cells were also treated with TGFb1 (2ng/ml) for 24 hours to promote myofibroblast differentiation.  RNA was isolated from these cells and cDNA libraries generated and sequenced with Azenta.

Raw fastqs and count matrixes are available at GEO GSE310601.
